        "title": "How useEffect Works",
        "paragraph1": "useEffect allows you to perform side effect operations in function components. It executes asynchronously after the component is rendered to the screen, so it doesn't block the browser's drawing process.",
        "paragraph2": "React compares whether the values in the dependency array have changed, and if they have changed, it executes the effect. This comparison is shallow, using Object.is to determine."

        "title": "Custom Hooks",
        "paragraph1": "Custom Hooks are one of the most powerful features of React Hooks. By extracting component logic into reusable functions, we can share state logic between different components.",
        "paragraph2": "A custom Hook is essentially a function whose name starts with \"use\" and can call other Hooks internally. This pattern makes code reuse elegant and natural."

        "title": "Summary",
        "description": "React Hooks have completely changed the way we write React components. They give function components all the capabilities of class components while maintaining the simplicity of functional programming. Understanding the design principles of Hooks helps us write better React code."
